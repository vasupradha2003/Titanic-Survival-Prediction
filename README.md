# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
A repository containing code and resources for predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can determine the likelihood of a passenger surviving a sinking event on the Titanic. By analyzing various factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more, we aim to understand the key factors that contribute to a person's chances of survival.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the famous Titanic dataset, which provides information about the passengers onboard the Titanic. The dataset includes features such as socio-economic status (Pclass), gender (Sex), age (Age), the number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp), the number of parents/children aboard (Parch), fare (Fare), cabin (Cabin), and port of embarkation (Embarked).

## Repository Contents
### titanic_prediction.ipynb:
Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.  

### README.md: 
This file, providing an overview of the project and repository.  

### requirements.txt:
List of required Python libraries and their versions.  


## Instructions
1.Clone the repository to your local machine.  

2.Ensure you have Python 3.x and the required libraries installed (listed in requirements.txt).  

3.Open the titanic_prediction.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.  

4.Run the cells in the Notebook to perform data preprocessing, analysis, model training, and evaluation.  

5.Customize the notebook as needed for further analysis or experimentation.  


## Results and Insights
The trained model achieves an accuracy of XX% on the test set, indicating its predictive power in determining survival outcomes. Through the analysis, we have discovered key factors that contribute significantly to a person's chances of survival, such as socio-economic status and gender.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the factors that contribute to survival during emergencies at sea, specifically in the context of the Titanic disaster. The predictive model developed here can be used to make predictions on new instances and gain a better understanding of the dynamics of survival.
