  This line imports the pandas library and allows you to use its functions and data structures.

2.Import numpy as np  : 
This line imports the NumPy library, which provides support for numerical operations and multi-dimensional arrays.

3.import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  :
This line imports the pyplot module from the matplotlib library, which enables you to create various types of plots and visualizations.

4.import seaborn as sns  :
